## About Me

I began in Frontend and grew into Full Stack Development, which sharpened both my technical breadth and delivery discipline. I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end—from UI/UX details and performance tuning to API design and database modeling.

My experience maps well to project leadership: I plan, slice, and ship iteratively, communicate clearly across teams, and keep scope aligned with outcomes. With Agile and Scrum, I focus on measurable value, fast feedback, and clean, maintainable code.

I’m also curious about electrical and electronics engineering, and I enjoy bridging software with hardware. This interdisciplinary interest helps me reason about systems holistically—from signals and sensors to services and interfaces.

---

## Commitment to Growth

I’m actively investing in better engineering practices, architectural thinking, and collaborative workflows. I’m ready to learn, adapt, and continuously improve—both as a developer and as a teammate. If there’s a challenge, I’ll meet it with curiosity and a plan.
